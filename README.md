# NEO Color Picker
This is a simple color picker to be used in Unity.

Currently it supports RGB, HSV and the hexadecimal codes.

## How to add
Currently there are no packages, but you can just clone this repository into your project.

To add the color picker to a scene, just drag the Color Picker prefab (found in the Prefabs folder) into a Canvas. You can easily modify the UI elements to suit your needs.

Don't worry that the color picker will appear white and without all the sliders in the Editor â€“ they are created at runtime. Those sliders are just prefabs in the Prefabs folder and can also be edited to suit your needs.

## How to use
To get or set the currently selected color, just use the color picker's `CurrentColor` property. Alternatively, you can add listeners to the `onColorChanged` event (via code or directly through the Inspector) to be called whenever the color changes.

An exemple scene can be found in the Example folder.
